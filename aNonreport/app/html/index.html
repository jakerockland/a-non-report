            <h1>What is aNonreport?</h1>
                <p>aNonreport is an online platform that enables users to file reports anonymously, including video & images, that can be geo-tagged and immediately sent to one or more monitoring organizations. It uses the latest in decentralized, anonymous communication technologies based on the same secure blockchain technology that bitcoin uses. By eliminating centralized servers and relying on multiple layers of encryption, users are assured of their anonymity, while receiving organizations are able to use a real-time updating system that is immune to traditional hacking exploits.</p>
                <p>aNonreport will have numerous applications, from election-day monitoring in domestic contexts to reporting attacks on civilians during, and even providing a whistleblowing platform for existing organizations. A scalable solution, the platform will eventually be able to enable one user’s report to be sent to multiple organizations simultaneously, while ensuring a complete digital chain of custody that can be verified for investigative purposes.</p>

            <h1>Possible Applications of aNonreport Include</h1>
            <p>Existing organizations that already have individuals in the field monitoring human rights violations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Instantly document attacks on civilians during wartime by observers</li>
                <li>Election monitoring reporting by field observers</li>
                <li>Post-facto interviewing of witnesses during human rights investigations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Individuals who want to anonymously report violations that they have experienced or documented such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Refugees or migrants en route submitting reports on their own experiences</li>
                <li>Citizens reporting on police violence or abuse</li>
                <li>Witnesses of corruption by especially when paired with apps like CameraV</li>

            <h3>How to Safely Send an aNonreport</h3>
            <p>aNonreport is designed to be highly secure and anonymous once a user has uploaded a file.</p>
            <p><strong>However, it does not protect you from anyone who might already be watching your internet connection and/or computer.</strong></p>
            <p>No system is 100% safe (and anyone who declares their system 100% safe is likely lying). The good news is that there are numerous applications today that make it easier to safely submit information. We have put together an easy guide that minimizes the chance that you will be exposed.</p>
            <h3>First Steps:</h3>
            <p>Safety begins with a few basic practices, starting with human intelligence [HUMINT] reminders.</p>
            <p><strong>Do not access aNonreport from work, school, or a government network.</strong> You can easily be tracked and, even if you are using Tor, can draw unwanted attention to yourself.</p>
            <p><strong>Do not tell anyone about sending information via aNonreport unless you are a part of a monitoring organization and fully understand necessary security protocols.</strong> This means not emailing, calling, discussing on social media, or any other forms of communication. Each channel holds the potential to be observed, which could then compromise your security.</p>
            <h3>Level 0 Security: Don’t Use Your Home Internet</h3>
                <p>Go and find a public network that no one can directly link to you. A public library, coffee shop, or other location with open WiFi is ideal. Do not use a credit card and, as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/01/28/how-to-leak-to-the-intercept/" target="_blank">The Intercept recommends</a>, leave your phone at home.</p>
            <h3>Level 1 Security: Use a properly configured version of Tor Browser for any connection to aNonreport.</h3>
                <p>You can install a modified version of Firefox that will always route through Tor from the Tor Project web page. This will give you a large degree of anonymity when accessing the service. <strong>You must access aNonreport through the Tor Browser for this to work.</strong> If you are uploading on mobile, you can access Tor through the combination of two apps, <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/" target="_blank">Orbot</a> and <a href="https://guardianproject.info/2015/06/30/orfox-aspiring-to-bring-tor-browser-to-android/" target="_blank">Orfox</a> from The Guardian Project.</p>
                <p>However, Tor will still leave traces of using it on your computer. Further, if your computer has been compromised by, say, a hostile government, Tor alone will not protect you. Like on desktop, installing the Orbot and Orfox apps will leave a digital record that you have been using Tor.</p>
            <h3>Level 2 Security: Use a secure operating system, Tails, for greater safety</h3>
                <p>Tor will largely keep your online actions private, but your computer will remain vulnerable to numerous forms of online surveillance. To protect yourself against many of those, you should install and run <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" target="_blank">Tails</a>, a highly secure operating system that will leave next-to-no trace of its use. <strong>We strongly recommend using Tails when uploading information that you believe could compromise your safety, or if you have reasonable suspicion that your online activities are being monitored.</strong></p>
            <h3>Level 3 Security: Use Tails on a randomly purchased computer</h3>
                <p>If you have strong reasons to believe that you are being monitored, consider purchasing a new computer. Implement a practice used by various human rights organizations doing war crimes investigations. Go to a random computer shop, select a new-in-box laptop, pay with cash, and do not use the computer for any other purpose. <strong>All previous levels of security should be followed.</strong> Eg. Tails should be used via a USB drive, and Tor used over a public WiFi network to access aNonreport.</p>
            <h3>Other Tips:</h3>
                <p>Consider encrypting all your messages and data. You can use <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/" target="_blank">Signal</a> or <a href="https://wickr.com/" target="_blank">Wickr</a> on iOS and Android for messaging. Micah Lee of The Intercept has an excellent guide to encrypting your laptop. </p>
                <p><strong> Through these steps, you can achieve a reasonable level of personal security. Once you have uploaded your file, we strip it of all metadata, apart from the Geotag location & time of the violation that you provide. It is then encrypted and decentrally distributed through <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/04/why-the-internet-needs-ipfs-before-its-too-late/" target="_blank">IPFS</a> until it is downloaded by the vetted organization that you chose upon uploading.</strong></p>
                <p><strong> In other words, we can assure your anonymity after uploading—but it’s up to you to follow the above steps for your own safety before then.</strong></p>
            <h3>How is aNonreport different than existing solutions like SecureDrop or Ushahidi?</h3>
                <p>aNonreport is different from any current reporting solution because it takes advantage of a completely decentralized, yet verifiable distribution network through IPFS and Ethereum. In plain English:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no central server to attack, meaning that all stored data cannot be located or hacked. There is no point of failure once uploaded.</li>
                <li>All data is ‘fingerprinted’ via a randomized security key, which allows organizations to track who has accessed the data & verify that it has not been corrupted. The user who uploaded the information remains entirely anonymous.</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Both users and organizations have to properly implement security protocol to protect their ends of the system, but aNonreport is designed to assure completely transparent, open-source, end-to-end security.</p>
